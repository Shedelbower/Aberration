# Aberration


## TODO
1. [ ] Swap entities using numbers 1-n
2. [ ] Custom rover physics for traveling on ground and up ramps
3. [ ] Security camera zoom in/out


## Ideas

### Setup
A disaster has struck a containment facility housing all sort of dangerous anomalies. You are part of a group of survivors who are trying to escape. You have access to a rover drone that you use to scout ahead to clear sections of the facility so the survivors can pass through.

### Gameplay
- Swap between different drones/cameras.
- Carefully navigate the corridors to avoid/corral enemies.
- Find a valid path to the end for your survivors to follow.
- Two game modes:
  - Drone explore & clear.
  - Watch survivors try to follow your path out.
- Number of survivors can act as your "health".
- Drones can be killed by enemies?
- Flagging hazards for survivors?
- Notice irregularities to find where anomalies are.
